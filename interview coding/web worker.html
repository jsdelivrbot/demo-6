<p>Delivers Full Duplex Communication Model for the Web WebSockets deliver
    communication between the client and server in both directions simultaneously.
    Prior to WebSockets, developers had to find a way to simulate full duplex
    communication by using a technique called polling and long-polling.
    But these techniques do not actually provide true duplex communication.
    In other words, data cannot be transferred between the server and client simultaneously.
    HTTP was not designed for this. This is where HTML5 sockets come into play.</p>
